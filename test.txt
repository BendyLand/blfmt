Cyberpunk Survival Colony: In a world ravaged by environmental collapse, players 
manage a small colony within the remnants of a once-great city. By day, they 
scavenge for cybernetic parts and resources in the ruins. By night, they fend 
off rogue AI and mutant creatures. Advanced tech can be upgraded or traded for 
survival essentials. 
Tech-Infused Wasteland: Set in a devastated metropolis where technology is both 
a boon and a bane. Players must navigate the city's dangerous streets during the 
day, collecting resources and hacking systems to survive. At night, advanced 
security drones and cybernetic predators become active, requiring strategic 
planning and tech utilization. 
Digital Desert: After a technological apocalypse, the world is a barren desert 
dotted with remnants of advanced civilizations. Players survive by day, 
gathering resources and avoiding hostile scavengers. At night, they can 
interface with ancient, hidden tech to unlock powerful upgrades and knowledge.
