1.1 Vector Spaces

A vector space 
𝑉
V over a field 
𝐹
F is a set equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. The set 
𝑉
V must satisfy the following axioms:

Closure under addition: For all 
𝑢
,
𝑣
∈
𝑉
u,v∈V, the sum 
𝑢
+
𝑣
∈
𝑉
u+v∈V.
Closure under scalar multiplication: For all 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V and all scalars 
𝑐
∈
𝐹
c∈F, the product 
𝑐
⋅
𝑣
∈
𝑉
c⋅v∈V.
Associativity of addition: For all 
𝑢
,
𝑣
,
𝑤
∈
𝑉
u,v,w∈V, 
(
𝑢
+
𝑣
)
+
𝑤
=
𝑢
+
(
𝑣
+
𝑤
)
(u+v)+w=u+(v+w).
Commutativity of addition: For all 
𝑢
,
𝑣
∈
𝑉
u,v∈V, 
𝑢
+
𝑣
=
𝑣
+
𝑢
u+v=v+u.
Identity element of addition: There exists an element 
0
∈
𝑉
0∈V such that for all 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V, 
𝑣
+
0
=
𝑣
v+0=v.
Inverse elements of addition: For each 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V, there exists an element 
−
𝑣
∈
𝑉
−v∈V such that 
𝑣
+
(
−
𝑣
)
=
0
v+(−v)=0.
Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition: For all 
𝑐
∈
𝐹
c∈F and 
𝑢
,
𝑣
∈
𝑉
u,v∈V, 
𝑐
⋅
(
𝑢
+
𝑣
)
=
𝑐
⋅
𝑢
+
𝑐
⋅
𝑣
c⋅(u+v)=c⋅u+c⋅v.
Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition: For all 
𝑐
,
𝑑
∈
𝐹
c,d∈F and 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V, 
(
𝑐
+
𝑑
)
⋅
𝑣
=
𝑐
⋅
𝑣
+
𝑑
⋅
𝑣
(c+d)⋅v=c⋅v+d⋅v.
Associativity of scalar multiplication: For all 
𝑐
,
𝑑
∈
𝐹
c,d∈F and 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V, 
(
𝑐
𝑑
)
⋅
𝑣
=
𝑐
⋅
(
𝑑
⋅
𝑣
)
(cd)⋅v=c⋅(d⋅v).
Identity element of scalar multiplication: For all 
𝑣
∈
𝑉
v∈V, 
1
⋅
𝑣
=
𝑣
1⋅v=v, where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity in 
𝐹
F.
1.2 Subspaces

A subset 
𝑊
W of a vector space 
𝑉
V is called a subspace if 
𝑊
W itself is a vector space under the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on 
𝑉
V. This implies that 
𝑊
W must satisfy the following conditions:

The zero vector of 
𝑉
V is in 
𝑊
W: 
0
∈
𝑊
0∈W.
Closed under addition: For all 
𝑢
,
𝑣
∈
𝑊
u,v∈W, the sum 
𝑢
+
𝑣
∈
𝑊
u+v∈W.
Closed under scalar multiplication: For all 
𝑣
∈
𝑊
v∈W and all scalars 
𝑐
∈
𝐹
c∈F, the product 
𝑐
⋅
𝑣
∈
𝑊
c⋅v∈W.
Example 1.1:

Consider the vector space 
𝑅
3
R 
3
  with standard addition and scalar multiplication. The set 
𝑊
=
{
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
)
∈
𝑅
3
∣
𝑥
+
𝑦
+
𝑧
=
0
}
W={(x,y,z)∈R 
3
 ∣x+y+z=0} is a subspace of 
𝑅
3
R 
3
 .

Proof:

The zero vector 
(
0
,
0
,
0
)
∈
𝑊
(0,0,0)∈W since 
0
+
0
+
0
=
0
0+0+0=0.
If 
(
𝑥
1
,
𝑦
1
,
𝑧
1
)
∈
𝑊
(x 
1
​
 ,y 
1
​
 ,z 
1
​
 )∈W and 
(
𝑥
2
,
𝑦
2
,
𝑧
2
)
∈
𝑊
(x 
2
​
 ,y 
2
​
 ,z 
2
​
 )∈W, then
(
𝑥
1
+
𝑦
1
+
𝑧
1
=
0
)
 and 
(
𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
+
𝑧
2
=
0
)
.
(x 
1
​
 +y 
1
​
 +z 
1
​
 =0) and (x 
2
​
 +y 
2
​
 +z 
2
​
 =0).
Therefore,
(
𝑥
1
+
𝑥
2
)
+
(
𝑦
1
+
𝑦
2
)
+
(
𝑧
1
+
𝑧
2
)
=
(
𝑥
1
+
𝑦
1
+
𝑧
1
)
+
(
𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
+
𝑧
2
)
=
0
+
0
=
0
,
(x 
1
​
 +x 
2
​
 )+(y 
1
​
 +y 
2
​
 )+(z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 )=(x 
1
​
 +y 
1
​
 +z 
1
​
 )+(x 
2
​
 +y 
2
​
 +z 
2
​
 )=0+0=0,
implying that 
(
𝑥
1
+
𝑥
2
,
𝑦
1
+
𝑦
2
,
𝑧
1
+
𝑧
2
)
∈
𝑊
(x 
1
​
 +x 
2
​
 ,y 
1
​
 +y 
2
​
 ,z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 )∈W.
If 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
)
∈
𝑊
(x,y,z)∈W and 
𝑐
∈
𝑅
c∈R, then
𝑥
+
𝑦
+
𝑧
=
0.
x+y+z=0.
Therefore,
𝑐
(
𝑥
+
𝑦
+
𝑧
)
=
𝑐
⋅
0
=
0
,
c(x+y+z)=c⋅0=0,
implying that 
(
𝑐
𝑥
,
𝑐
𝑦
,
𝑐
𝑧
)
∈
𝑊
(cx,cy,cz)∈W.
Thus, 
𝑊
W is a subspace of 
𝑅
3
R 
3
 .
